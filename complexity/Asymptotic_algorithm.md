 # Big O notation & time complexity

 ## Algorithm analysis

 Algorithm analysis is a study to provide theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem i.e calculating efficiency.Genraly effeciency of an algorithm is related to input lenght,known as time complexity,volume of memory is known as time complexity.

 ## Need of algorithm

 Knowing efficiency of  an algorithm is very vital on mission critical tasks. Generally there are multiple methods to solve one problem.

 ## Asymptotic algorithm analysis

 It is used mathematically calculate the running time of any operation inside any algorithm.
 ## Time complexity

 Is a computational way to show how (behavior)runtime of a program increases(changes) as the size of input incrreases.
 // Write an algorithm to find sum of N numbers

 sumOfNumbers(N){
     sum = 0;
     for(i = 0;to N){
         sum = sum+i;
         print sum
     }
 } 

 // 2nd Algorithm
 
 sumOfNumbers(N){
      
         sum = (N*(N+1))/2
         (print sum)
     }
